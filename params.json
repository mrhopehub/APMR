APMR reads the power (W) and energy (Wh) readings of RS485/Modbus communicating power meters at a constant interval. Readings are recorded on an SD cards and/or sent over the Internet using a HTTP RESTful web service.\r\n\r\nWe are currently working on Version 2.0 which will include some great features (listed in the Release History section). \r\n\r\nStay tuned.\r\n\r\n## The Hardware\r\nAPMR used an [Arduino Mega 2560](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardMega2560) with two custom shields: the RTC (real-time clock) Shield and the RS485 Shield. \r\n\r\n![Arduino Power Meter Reader](https://raw.github.com/smakonin/APMR/master/resources/apmr_hardware.png \"Arduino Power Meter Reader\")\r\n\r\nEach custom shield can be create using a [Arduino Proto Shield](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoProtoShield) and the following schematics: \r\n * [The RTC Shield schematic](https://raw.github.com/smakonin/APMR/master/resources/rtc-module-schematic.pdf) _Based on the [SparkFun Real Time Clock Module](http://www.sparkfun.com/products/99)._ ![The RTC Shield](https://raw.github.com/smakonin/APMR/master/resources/rtc_shield.png \"The RTC Shield\")\r\n * [The RS485 Shield schematic](https://raw.github.com/smakonin/APMR/master/resources/rs485_shield_schematic.pdf) ![The RS485 Shield](https://raw.github.com/smakonin/APMR/master/resources/rs485_shield.png \"The RS485 Shield\")\r\n\r\n## Project Team\r\n**Project Leader(s):**\r\n* Stephen Makonin\r\n\r\n**Student Contributors:**\r\n* TaeJin Moon (Summer 2012)\r\n\r\n## License and Legal\r\nCopyright (C) 2010-2012 Stephen Makonin and contributors.
